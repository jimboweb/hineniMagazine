I am here.
Hineni.
I am here
Even though society does its best to erase me.
I'm good for nothing, or so they say.
I don't deserve a roof over my head.
I don't deserve to be taken care of like a "real" person.

Why do I make them so angry?
Why do they blame me for being a victim of my body?
If I disappeared tomorrow, how would it change their lives?
It wouldn't.
I'm not going anywhere.
They can't erase me.
They can't pretend I don't exist. 
Not anymore.
I've found my voice
I'm not afraid to use it.
Hineni.
I am here.
