            <pre>
I am worried 
For my sisters brothers
Carrying tradition heavy
On shoulders sprayed into ice
By angry corporate militia in the guise of
North dakotaâ€™s finest
What will happen to
Peaceful prayers confronted
By the dollars invested 
By Trump in a ready to leak pipeline
We hold our breaths waiting
For the blood to spill a sacrifice to mammon
And Obama stands at the oval office window
as  blood splashes bright red against 
Crisp white
 snow
