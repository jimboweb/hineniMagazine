                SAN LORENZO CANYON 2
            </h2>
            <pre>
I’m just a white American male
in a seated position. I’m a staple
in a box of 5000. 

Clouds coast across the bluffs.
Little winged bugs land on me,
here’s one with a green body,
here’s one secreting a sex hormone in a swarm, 
here’s the last gnat of summer.

I hear men up and down the canyon firing guns. 
210 staples in a strip and I’ll be the one 
that’s not reckless, the one hung up 
in the machinery. I’ll watch the fire die
from a cot inside my van.

1
Air conditioning 
approaches the ear 
of a drone pilot
his finger in Nevada 
on the joystick’s trigger
his cockpit with the top down. 
Most the time my mind
flaps around the patio
like a maniac dove. Right now
where is your mind? Is it here 
or is it faking it somewhere
like Vaseline smeared in the air 
above a highway in summer.
Is it worth fighting about?

This is the ideal: unalarmed absences. 

2
A good day is drawn by a 5 year old
with an ice cube on hot pavement.
Shapes drying fast as they’re drawn. 
No one is thinking about the slaying
on a good day. No one I love has sadness 
hidden in their stomach on a good day.

I’m trying to say I ignore the killing gracefully.  

3
There’s no post-war poet today
blood is too actively shed
and I’ve read enough women poets
to know they bleed for life
and men bleed against it. 

I’ll stop reading. I’ll be a 10 foot ladder on the ocean floor. 

4
Bramble stream, white rocks poking out.
The sky is Hope Diamond blue.
Look at me hiding under a stone
in the Aldo Leopold
in the dark home of some
black spider who kills 
but killing to eat 
isn’t anybody’s fault. 
Touch the Hope Diamond 
and you may get stabbed 
or blue-eyed parricided
or worse.

Neruda says poetry is an act of peace, is that only war poetry?

5
I buried the soldier in me
like a placenta that still
pulses underground. 
Lynn Strongin says 
tough-minded poetry
will necessarily 
be the most triumphant
in the end. 

A mind isn’t tough at all, it’s blown to shreds in a second.

                THE TRANSPLANTS
            </h2>
            <pre>
I chop a dozen locust trees 
with a spade
from their mother roots. 

The transplants ride in milk cartons 
and Walmart bags in back of the van.

I’ll dig holes for them the opposite of graves.
They’re too young to know 
they weren’t wanted in their birth lawn.  
They clench the sphincter of their leaves
as the wind pounds on.
