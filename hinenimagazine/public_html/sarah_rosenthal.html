            <p>
                Dear, it's late and I'm tired but I wanted to make sure you've heard, how this one recites names of flowers and famous pairs of lovers to fend off the dark, and this one wonders where a favorite blue jacket sauntered off to--she has her suspicions--and this one sings because his bones are clean, and this one paces in the wee hours waiting for trains, and this one is too sad for metaphors, and this one and this one and this one are scared about the loss of metaphors and what that spells. I'm telling you because you asked, because you love them too, or you would if you did, know them I mean, I don't and I do. I'll see you in my dreams.
