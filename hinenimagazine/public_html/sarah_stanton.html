            </h2>
            <pre>
when the snake
belly-up in 
the hungry wide 
river says go
build a home,
you go

and the house
that you build
is the egg of a
bird and the
gift of a
shiver in snow

and the flies
and the wide 
eyes stick to 
you, kick you 
below and
you know then,
you know

that faith
is a window
that half of 
you looks
through
while half
of you
just
overflows
